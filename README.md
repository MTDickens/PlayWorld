[**Project**](https://kxding.github.io/project/PlayWorld/) | [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.13552) | [**Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jocelynd/playworld-bench) | [**Leaderboard**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jocelynd/PlayWorld-Leaderboard)

Video generation-based world models simulate future states conditioned on the current observation and user-provided actions, but their interactive nature makes fair comparison difficult: the action sequences needed to accomplish the same long-horizon objective can differ substantially across models.

PlayWorld therefore drives evaluation by objectives rather than predetermined action sequences. A multi-modal **Agent Player** interacts with each world model in a closed loop and adaptively plans actions toward the same high-level objective. The benchmark uses VQA-based metrics to assess geometric consistency, interaction fidelity, insight evolution, and out-of-sight evolution, together with automatic metrics for further evaluation. Experiments on representative world models show that current systems remain unreliable on long-horizon interactive objectives and continue to struggle with key world-model capabilities.

## Installation

Python 3.10 or newer is required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kxding/PlayWorld.git
cd PlayWorld
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Install the browser runtime when evaluating web-based models such as Genie3 or HappyOyster:

```bash
python3 -m playwright install chromium
```

## Data Preparation

Download the complete [PlayWorld dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jocelynd/playworld-bench) into this repository's ignored `data/` directory:

```bash
hf download jocelynd/playworld-bench --type dataset --local-dir data
```

If the dataset is access-restricted, first request access on Hugging Face and run `hf auth login`. This repository does not download or commit the benchmark data automatically.

The resulting layout should be:

## Inference Protocol

Inference is driven by an **Agent Player**, which consists of two parts:

- **agent model:** the VLM that observes the latest generated frame, reasons about objective progress, and predicts the next action. The paper uses Claude Haiku for every evaluated world model.
- **Agent Interface and Harness:** the code provided in this repository. It prepares the initial frame, long-horizon objective, step count, and recent action history for the agent model; validates its response; routes the selected action to each world model's native interface; captures the next observation; enforces the shared step budget; and records the rollout.

### Inference requirements

Running inference requires both the target world-model interface and an agent
model API:

- **World-model session:** Genie3 requires a dedicated Chrome CDP session
  launched with `Agent_player/genie3/launch_chrome_cdp.sh`. Running this bash
  script opens a Google Chrome window. Sign in to Genie3 manually in that Chrome
  profile before starting a task. HappyOyster and HYWorld2 use the equivalent
  launch scripts in their model directories and likewise require manual login
  in the opened Chrome window.
- **agent model API:** configure the VLM used to make closed-loop decisions.
  The paper uses Claude Haiku. Copy `Agent_player/api_keys.example.sh` to the
  ignored `Agent_player/api_keys.sh`, replace its `xxx` placeholders, or export
  the corresponding environment variables.

```bash
cp Agent_player/api_keys.example.sh Agent_player/api_keys.sh
# Edit api_keys.sh with the Claude Haiku agent model API settings.
Agent_player/genie3/launch_chrome_cdp.sh
```

After the launch script opens Google Chrome, log in to the target world-model
service manually and keep that browser window open while running the task
script.

The Chrome/CDP session provides access to Genie3; the Claude Haiku API drives
the Agent Player. Neither one is used as the evaluation judge.

**Every world model receives the same initial frame and long-horizon objective, never a predetermined action or camera sequence.** The Agent Player therefore adapts its actions independently to the observations returned by each world model.

The shared action vocabulary includes `W/A/S/D`, arrow keys, and `WAIT`. Model adapters translate these Agent Player decisions to each model's native interface. An episode ends when the agent model outputs `FINISH` or reaches the 40-step limit.

The Agent Interface and harness are reusable across agent models. Agent model credentials are read from `Agent_player/api_keys.sh` or environment variables.

`Agent_player/player.py` defines the shared Agent Interface lifecycle. Each model-specific directory provides an Agent Interface harness for observation capture, native action execution, rollout recording, and model-specific browser automation, while `Agent_player/your-models/` is the copyable integration template. Complete harnesses are provided for Genie3, HappyOyster, and HYWorld2; see [Agent_player/README.md](Agent_player/README.md) for setup and credentials.

Run task `GC004` from the repository root:

Genie3:

```bash
Agent_player/genie3/launch_chrome_cdp.sh
GENIE3_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/Agent_player/example" \
GENIE3_DATA_FILES="GC:GC/001.json" \
Agent_player/genie3/run_task.sh GC004
```

HappyOyster:

```bash
Agent_player/happyoyster/launch_chrome_cdp.sh
HAPPYOYSTER_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/Agent_player/example" \
HAPPYOYSTER_DATA_FILES="GC:GC/001.json" \
Agent_player/happyoyster/run_task.sh GC004
```

HYWorld2:

```bash
Agent_player/hyworld2/launch_chrome_cdp.sh
HYWORLD2_DATA_ROOT="$PWD/Agent_player/example" \
Agent_player/hyworld2/run_task.sh GC004
```

Each launch script opens a Google Chrome window. Sign in to the corresponding
world-model service manually in that window, keep it open, and then run the task
script. Account credentials are never stored in this repository.

## Output Directory Structure

Use one directory per model and task. The reusable player writes the following canonical artifacts; model-specific adapters may add native videos, recordings, execution logs, and intermediate observations.

```text
outputs/
└── <model>/
    └── <task_id>/
        ├── before_actions.jpg
        ├── after_actions.jpg
        ├── result.json
        └── <task_video>.mp4

evaluation/
└── <model>/
    ├── <task_id>_score.json
    └── <task_id>_score_context.json
```

Keep generated videos, evaluation outputs, caches, and API credentials outside Git tracking.

## Running Evaluation

### Step 1: VQA Rubric Verifier

PlayWorldEval uses task-conditioned Gemini 3.1 Pro as the **Rubric Verifier**. This scoring role is separate from Agent Player inference. Each video is decoded into synchronized 10 FPS primary and 0.5 FPS detail streams, then verified against the sample-specific weighted 1–5 rubric. Geometry Consistency and applicable Interaction Fidelity/Out-of-sight cases also use a Pass/Partial/Fail instruction-following gate; an applicable `Fail` contributes an effective score of 1.

Evaluation therefore requires a separate **Gemini 3.1 Pro API key**. The Agent
Model credential used during inference, such as the Claude Haiku API key,
cannot replace it. Configure the verifier key through `GEMINI_API_KEY` or the
`api_key="xxx"` placeholder in `run_vqa_score.sh`.

Edit the configuration block at the top of `run_vqa_score.sh`, including the explicit placeholder:

```bash
api_key="xxx"
dataset="$PWD/data/gc/data.json"
task_id="GC002"
video="$PWD/outputs/genie3/GC002/GC002_full_process.mp4"
reference_image="$PWD/data/gc/images/GC002.jpg"
```

Then run:

```bash
chmod +x run_vqa_score.sh
./run_vqa_score.sh
```

Credentials may instead be provided without editing the file:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY="xxx" \
DATASET="$PWD/data/gc/data.json" \
TASK_ID=GC002 \
VIDEO="$PWD/outputs/genie3/GC002/GC002_full_process.mp4" \
REFERENCE_IMAGE="$PWD/data/gc/images/GC002.jpg" \
OUTPUT="$PWD/evaluation/genie3/GC002_score.json" \
./run_vqa_score.sh
```

Use `DRY_RUN=1 ./run_vqa_score.sh` to validate sampling and prompt construction without making an API call. The complete scoring path is documented in [metrics/vqa/README.md](metrics/vqa/README.md).

### Step 2: Automatic Metrics

`metrics/automatic/` is intentionally empty. Automatic video quality and controllability metrics can be added by referring to the official implementations from [VBench](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench), [Omni-WorldBench](https://github.com/AMAP-ML/Omni-WorldBench), and [WorldMark](https://github.com/AlayaLab/WorldMark).

## License

The code and benchmark assets have different release considerations. Initial images originate from multiple sources, including Pexels and web image search results, so dataset users must follow the source-specific license or redistribution restrictions documented with the dataset. A single permissive license must not be assumed to cover every image asset.
